  NIST: Reusable Hybrid Multi-Services Data Analytics Framework
---

{{% pageinfo %}}
Over the last several years, the computation landscape for conducting
data an- alytics has completely changed. While in the past a lot of
the activities have been undertaken in isolation by companies and
research institutions, todayâ€™s in- frastructure constitutes a wealth
of services offered by a variety of providers that offer opportunities
for reuse and interactions.

We will expand analytics services to focus on developing a frame- work
for reusable hybrid multi-service data analytics. It includes (a) a
technology review that explicitly targets the intersection of hybrid
multi-provider analytics services (b) enhancing the concepts of
services to showcase how hybrid, as well as multi-provider services,
can be integrated and reused via the proposed framework, (d) address
analytics service composition, and (c) integrate container
technologies to achieve state-of-the-art analytics service deployment
capabilities.
