## MLCommons Science Cloudmask benchmark

The scientific objective of CloudMask is to develop a segmentation
model for classifying the pixels in satellite images. This
classification allows to determine whether the given pixel belongs to
a cloud or to a clear sky. The benchmark can be considered as both
training and inference focused, where the science metric is same as
the classification accuracy â€” number of pixels classified correctly.
The performance metric, can be inference timing and scalability on the
training across a number of GPUs.
