## Biography

Jacques is an undergraduate computer science major
in the Computing for Global Challenges
program of the Biocomplexity Institute at the University
of Virginia. His interests include leveraging artificial
intelligence to analyze timeseries; he also
uses high performance computing to conduct geospatial 
AI predictions.

## Project

The *tevelop* earthquake benchmark analyzes historical data and forecasts 
earthquakes with Normalized Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NNSE) as a measure of 
accuracy. The benchmark is ran several times in parallel on several graphics
cards and varying epochs to find the best hyperparameter combination.

The *cloudmask* benchmark reads satellite imagery and classifies portions
of images as cloudy or clear sky. Validation loss and inference accuracy
are used to identify which epoch number is ideal for optimal classification.

**Compute Resources:** 500 GPU-accelerated Slurm hours

**Data Resources:** at least 5 TB of space for data storage
