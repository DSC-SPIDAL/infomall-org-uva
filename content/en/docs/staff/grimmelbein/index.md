## Project 

Candle Uno utilizes deep learning architectures to predict tumor response to single and paired drugs. Candle combats the problems of cellular, molecular, and population problems within cancer. The project is trained with a subset of dose-response data from six data sources. Benchmark Pilot1 (P1) focuses on the molecular features of tumor cells from a singular data source, CCLE, to accelerate the use of effective drugs to cure cancerous cells.
