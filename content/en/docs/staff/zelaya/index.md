## Project 

State of the art scanning transmission electron microscopes (STEM) produce focused electron beams with atomic dimensions and allow to capture diffraction patterns arising from the interaction of incident electrons with nanoscale material volumes. Backing out the local atomic structure of said materials requires compute- and time-intensive analyses of these diffraction patterns (known as convergent beam electron diffraction, CBED). Traditional analyses of CBED requires iterative numerical solutions of partial differential equations and comparison with experimental data to refine the starting material configuration. This process is repeated anew for every newly acquired experimental CBED pattern and/or probed material.
